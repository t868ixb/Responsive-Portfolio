        Hello!  Welcome to my bio page.  My name is Isaac Bayon, and I have a love of learning.  As a personal challenge, I push myself to learn something new every year.  In the past few years I’ve done the following to force me out of my comfort zone: 
        <ul>
            
            <li>Guitar lessons</li>
            <li>Swimming lessons</li>
            <li>Ice skating lessons</li>
            <li>Full stack developer bootcamp</li>
            
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        During the day I work for a financial institution in Chicago.  The best way to describe 
        what I do is with an air traffic controller analogy.  I’m responsible for safely landing software code in the production environment by ensuring code deployments don’t crash into each other as they reach their intended location.
      </p>

      <p>For most of my professional career I’ve worked in Technology Operations.  I’ve had an opportunity to work with software engineers and product owners to support their final product once it’s gone live.  I’ve also had the opportunity to manage teams of people in which my focus is to ensure their professional success and the success of the goals of the business teams we supported.</p>
