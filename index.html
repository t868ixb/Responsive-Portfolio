                            Hello!  Welcome to my bio page.  My name is Isaac Bayon, and I have a love of learning.  As a personal challenge, I push myself to learn something new every year.  In the past few years I’ve done the following to force me out of my comfort zone: 
                            <ul><strong>
                                
                                <li>Guitar lessons</li>
                                <li>Swimming lessons</li>
                                <li>Ice skating lessons</li>
                                <li>Full stack developer bootcamp</li>
                                
                            </strong></ul>
                    </P>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row"> <!-- using this row for 2nd half of content-->
            <div class="col-md-12">
                    <P>During the day I work for a financial institution in Chicago.  The best way to describe 
                            what I do is with an air traffic controller analogy.  I’m responsible for safely landing
                             software code in the production environment by ensuring code deployments don’t crash 
                             into each other as they reach their intended location.
                    
                        </P>
                        <P>For most of my professional career I’ve worked in Technology Operations.  I’ve had an 
                            opportunity to work with code developers and product owners to support their final product 
                            once it’s gone live.  I’ve also had the opportunity to manage teams of people in which my 
                            focus was to ensure their professional success and the success of the goals of the business
                             teams we supported.
                    
                        </P>
                        <p>
                                For fun I like to read and hike –sometimes both at the same time &#9786;.  As a family 
                                we visit one or more National parks a year.  It’s a good time to reflect on all the 
                                natural wonders of our planet and to also take time to replenish the mind and soul.
